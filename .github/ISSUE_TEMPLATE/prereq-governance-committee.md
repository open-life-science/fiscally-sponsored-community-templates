Governance committee: A potential FSC must define a governance structure which contains at least  three people, and specify their roles within the organisation. 
- [ ] <NAME 1>, Country, <role in org, e.g. “director”>
- [ ] <NAME 2>, Country, <role in org, e.g. “director”>
- [ ] <NAME 3>, Country, <role in org, e.g. “director”>

If you are unable to complete this step, you may wish to consider a Resident Fellowship instead.
