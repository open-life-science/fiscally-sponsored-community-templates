Required doc before OLS is able to consider onboarding an FSC: **Dispute Resolution Process/policy**. 

The policy must answer, at a minimum, what happens when there is a dispute between:
- [ ] Governance committee members;
- [ ] Governance committee and FSC leadership (if the two are different);
- [ ] Between members of the FSC leadership, e.g. co-directors/senior members of staff;


IMPORTANT: All roles / committees must be clearly defined. Who is in each committee/group, and how they get there.
